# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: 2025-10-30T03:15:00+01:00

I was asked to perform:
Build an MCP server for filing complaints

I was given these context information's:
- Use the Go MCP SDK
- Create a complaint form with specific fields
- Store complaints locally and globally
- File naming convention with timestamps

I was missing these information:
- Clear error handling patterns for the MCP SDK
- Examples of proper input validation in MCP tools
- Best practices for structuring MCP server projects
- Testing strategies for MCP servers

I was confused by:
- The MCP SDK documentation structure and examples
- How to properly handle different transport types
- Schema validation approach for complex input types

What I wish for the future is:
- More comprehensive examples in the MCP SDK documentation
- Clear guidelines on project structure for MCP servers
- Better testing utilities and examples for MCP implementations
- Standardized patterns for error handling and validation
